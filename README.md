## Abstract

Include your abstract here. This should be one paragraph clearly describing your concept, method, and results. This should tell us what architecture/approach you used. Also describe your creative goals, and whether you were successful in achieving them. Also could describe future directions.

I began brainstorming for this project just thinking about things that I'm interested in or are inspiring me right now. I went to MeowWolf in LasVegas last year and have been inpired since by the Omega Mart section of the experience. It got me thinking about AI generated text and how if the products in Omega Mart were in fact AI generate it would have fit in so perfectly with the story they were trying to convey as well. I also really like how when I read different AI generated texts it feels like I am reading some weird alien propoganda that's trying to trick us into thinking it was written by a human. I think it would be cool to play with this idea for cosmetic products/slogans or like different foods. I want to make a generative text of either different food or cosmetics names/slogans and then create a poster advertising it.

## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data). what is your corpus?

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- training_code.py or training_code.ipynb - your training code
- generative_code.py or generative_code.ipynb - your generation code

## Results

- Documentation of your generative text in an effective form. A file with your generated text (.pdf, .doc, .txt). 

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)

## Reference

References to any papers, techniques, repositories you used:
- Papers
  - [This is a paper](this_is_the_link.pdf)
